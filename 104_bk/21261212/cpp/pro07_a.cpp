Whatâ€™s the difference between a stack and a heap? How is memory allocated on the stack and heap? How do threads interact with the stack and the heap?

Ans:

gcc --version

Under My Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS VM, execute "gcc -o pro07 pro07.cpp" to test codes.

Difference between stack and heap:

In this example, we have a variable x that is allocated on the stack and a pointer y that is allocated on the heap using the new operator. 
The value of x is assigned to 5, while the value of y is assigned to 10. 
We then print the values of x and y on the console. 
Finally, we deallocate the memory allocated on the heap using the delete operator.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 5; // allocated on the stack
    int* y = new int(10); // allocated on the heap
    std::cout << "x: " << x << std::endl;
    std::cout << "y: " << *y << std::endl;
    delete y; // deallocate memory on the heap
    return 0;
}
